# Dependencies
- make
- fzf
- ccc
- nodejs

Install them however you want as long as they're available in the PATH.

This is how I did it:
> scoop install make gcc fzf

Node.js was installed from [the website](https://nodejs.org/en).

# Java dependencies
JDTLS requires Java 21 or higher to run the langauge server.

You can change the runtime at any time to use a different version if you are bound to a specific version in the projects. But the language server itself needs Java 21 to run the launcher.
